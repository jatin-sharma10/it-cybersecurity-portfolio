IT & Cybersecurity Portfolio

This repository contains hands-on projects demonstrating foundational skills across:

IT support and troubleshooting

Cloud infrastructure and serverless architecture (AWS)

Networking fundamentals

Cybersecurity concepts, logging, and defensive analysis

The focus of this portfolio is clear documentation, structured system design, and real-world operational scenarios, rather than exploit development or unsafe experimentation.

Each project is scoped to reflect how systems are designed, secured, monitored, and maintained in professional environments.

Projects Included
1. Internal Records API (Serverless Hospital Infrastructure)

Design and implementation of a serverless internal records service using AWS managed services.
The system supports non-clinical operational records, emphasizing secure access, auditability, observability, and cost-aware infrastructure design.

Key areas covered include API Gateway, AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, IAM least-privilege access, CloudWatch logging, and operational monitoring.

2. Cybersecurity Incident Tracking Database (PostgreSQL)

Design of a relational database to log, track, and analyze cybersecurity incidents using structured schemas and analytical queries.
This project focuses on data modeling, normalization, and querying to support incident response and post-incident analysis workflows.

3. Server Infrastructure Design (Hybrid On-Prem + Cloud)

Architecture and disaster recovery planning for a mid-sized organization transitioning from legacy on-premises servers to a modern hybrid environment.
The project evaluates availability, backup strategies, failover considerations, and operational tradeoffs between on-prem and cloud systems.

4. SolarWinds Orion Supply Chain Compromise – Case Study

Technical and strategic analysis of the SolarWinds Orion breach, focusing on attacker methodology, supply chain risk, detection gaps, and defensive controls.
The case study emphasizes lessons learned and practical mitigation strategies relevant to enterprise environments.

5. IPv6 Network Design and Routing

Design and validation of an IPv6 network using Cisco Packet Tracer, including addressing schemes, routing configuration, and access control concepts.
The project demonstrates understanding of modern IP networking fundamentals and transition considerations.

6. AWS Static Website Hosting & Secure Delivery

Design and deployment of a personal portfolio website using AWS managed services.
The project focuses on secure static hosting, HTTPS enforcement, global content delivery, and minimal operational overhead using services such as Amazon S3, CloudFront, and AWS Certificate Manager.
