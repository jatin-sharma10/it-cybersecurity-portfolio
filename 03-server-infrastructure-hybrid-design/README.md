## Server Infrastructure Design (Hybrid On-Prem + Cloud)

This project documents the design of a hybrid server infrastructure for a mid-sized organization.

The focus is on:
- Virtualized on-prem infrastructure
- Redundancy and high availability
- Storage architecture (SAN/NAS)
- Backup and disaster recovery planning
- RTO/RPO considerations

The attached PDF contains the full architecture proposal and supporting rationale.
